# Scottish-Independence---2014-Weight-Effect

# This repository contains four files.
# One of these files is a PDF write-up of a regression model examining the relationship between whether an opinion poll on Scottish independence poll reports different levels of pro-independence voting intention based on whether it weights data to the results of the 2014 Scottish independence referendum or not.
# 'R Markdown Code for Replication' contains all the code necessary to replicate the analysis and robustness tests, 'Raw Data for Replication' contains the data needed to replicate the analysis.
# 'IndependenceVI' contains the basic data (minus lag variables) and notes on how the data is coded.
